# 💰 Ryan's Expense Tracker (Azure Deployment)

Welcome to my cloud-deployed expense tracking project!  
This application demonstrates how I’ve used **Spring Boot**, **PostgreSQL**, and **Microsoft Azure App Service** to create a full-stack web application that tracks personal expenses with live database updates and a clean, responsive interface.

## 💡 Features
- Add, edit, and delete expenses in real time  
- Automatic **“Date Added”** tracking for each new entry  
- Deployed on **Microsoft Azure App Service**  
- Backed by **Azure Database for PostgreSQL**  
- Responsive, gradient-themed interface  
- Toast notifications for success and error messages  

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
**Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript  
**Backend:** Spring Boot 3 (Java 17)  
**Database:** Azure Database for PostgreSQL  
**Build Tool:** Maven  
**Deployment:** Microsoft Azure App Service (CLI deployment)  

---

## 🚀 How It Works
1. The frontend sends CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) via REST endpoints.  
2. Spring Boot handles incoming requests, interacts with the PostgreSQL database, and returns JSON responses.  
3. The Azure App Service hosts the Spring Boot JAR, automatically exposing the API and static frontend files.  
4. The database is hosted on **Azure Database for PostgreSQL**, connected securely using environment variables (`DB_PASSWORD`).  
5. Users can add, update, or remove expenses directly from the browser — updates reflect instantly.
